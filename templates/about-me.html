      I’m Renz — a curious, hands-on, and slightly all-over-the-place kind of tech enthusiast (in the best way possible).
    </p>

    <p class="about-story">
      Back in university at PUP Quezon City, I started out with a passion for design — UI/UX caught my eye first. But that was just the beginning. I eventually found myself diving into frontend, backend, and everything in between — which led me to become a full-stack developer...

    I tried on the hat of a Project Manager, leading teams, writing documentation, and keeping things on track. Then came Quality Assurance, where I discovered the thrill of catching bugs, writing test cases, and ensuring things actually work the way they’re supposed to.

    <h1 class="about-reverse-title">Quality Assurance</h1>
    <p class="about-reverse-body">
      While often seen as the quiet, behind-the-scenes role, I see QA as the glue that holds great projects together. Testing, documentation, debugging — it all matters. And I genuinely enjoy doing it.

      Welcome to my portfolio — a little corner of the web that shows where I’ve been, what I’ve built, and what I love doing.
