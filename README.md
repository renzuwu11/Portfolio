Personal Portfolio Website — Quality Assurance & Web Projects
Welcome to my personal portfolio!
This site is a showcase of who I am as a tech enthusiast, especially leaning into my growing expertise in Quality Assurance.

🔍 From breaking things (gently) to building user-friendly websites, this portfolio highlights my projects, resume, and journey as a BSIT student. It includes:
💼 Project Section: A carousel and lightbox view for each of my full-stack and front-end projects.
🧠 About Me: A personal intro that reflects my mindset as a QA-focused developer.
📄 Resume Page: Interactive and neatly structured resume section.
📬 Contact Page: A fully working contact form that sends messages directly to my email using Flask-Mail.

Built using:
- Flask for the backend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend
- Flask-Mail for email handling
- Fully responsive and styled with custom fonts and effects

Let’s squash some bugs together.
